Also, notice the use of the function `show`, which is needed to display the figure. We also use several `numpy` functions such as `meshgrid` (for coordinate matrices), `arange` (for froming evenly spaced values within a given interval), and `reshape` (for reshaping an array). The `plot_svc()` function takes as first argument a `SVC` object, which we just learnt how to use it.
